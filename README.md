# Wormy
This is my Wormy game written in Python using Pygame.
The aim is simple: control the worm, eat apples, and try not to crash into walls or even yourself

I made this to learn basic game programming in Python just to start off, i hope to improve maintainability in the future just like the code in the book.

I used Al Sweigart’s book Making Games with Python & Pygame to help me understand all the concepts:
